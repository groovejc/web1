    <p> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language
      for <strong> creating <u>web</u> page</strong> and web applications.
      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
      and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
      a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of
      the document.

  <p style="margin-top:45px;"> HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms,
    may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create
    structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
    headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements
    are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.

    The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
